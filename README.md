2. **Configure Settings**: Visit the **Settings Tab** to add API keys for TTS services (e.g., Eleven Labs, AWS Polly) and configure storage (local, remote, or cloud).
3. **Create Content**: Use the **Main Tab** to input text, add sound effect placeholders, and generate audio via **Section Cards**. Explore the **Templates Tab** for pre-built setups.
4. **Generate and Merge**: Click **Generate Audio** for individual sections, then **Merge** to combine them into a single file. Download the result from the **AudioPlayer**.
5. **Learn More**: Refer to `USER_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions and troubleshooting tips.

### For Developers
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd crystal-cloud-tts-spa

Install Dependencies:
Frontend: npm install

Backend (optional, for local TTS): cd py_server && pip install -r requirements.txt

Set Up Prerequisites: Ensure Node.js (v14+), Python 3.x, and ffmpeg are installed and accessible in your PATH.

<summary>Detailed Explanations of Documentation Files</summary>

**DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md**
Purpose: This file serves as the primary resource for developers contributing to or maintaining the Crystal Cloud Text-to-Speech SPA. It covers the project’s technical foundation, including the Next.js/React frontend, Python backend for local TTS, and integrations with external TTS services (e.g., Eleven Labs, AWS Polly). It explains the dual-context state management system (TTSContext for persistent data, TTSSessionContext for session data), data flow, and core components like TTSApp.jsx and SectionCard.jsx. The guide also provides setup instructions, testing procedures, and steps for extending the app.
Key Details:
Architecture: Details the frontend (Next.js, Tailwind CSS), backend (Python server in py_server/), and API routes for external services.

Setup: Lists prerequisites (Node.js, Python, ffmpeg) and steps to install dependencies and start development servers.

Development: Explains how to add features (e.g., new TTS providers in services/api/speechEngineAPIs/), run tests (npm test), and deploy (e.g., as a static site or with a separate Python microservice).

Engagement: Developers should use this as a starting point to set up their environment, understand the codebase, and follow guidelines for contributions. It’s essential for onboarding and feature development.

**MY_STORY.md**
Purpose: This file shares the creator’s personal journey, from overcoming Kundalini disturbances and trauma to building the app as a tool for audio content creation. It describes the frustrations with existing TTS and editing tools that led to the app’s development, initially as a personal solution for podcasts like Bambi Cloud, Crystal Cloud, and Glaum Cloud. The file emphasizes the app’s mission to remove technical barriers, reduce costs, and empower creators with an open-source platform.
Key Details:
Background: The creator, a Kundalini Yogi and technologist, started in 2021 with raw audio projects for healing, evolving into polished podcasts.

Motivation: Frustrations with costly APIs, manual audio syncing, and workflow disruptions drove the app’s creation, starting as a simple script and growing into a web app by 2025.

Vision: Aims to foster self-expression, break down paywalls, and build creator communities, with a nod to future Web3 integration for cost-free services.

Engagement: Creators can connect with the app’s purpose, try it for their projects, and join communities via linked resources. Supporters can offer feedback or donations to support the mission.

**PITCH.md**
Purpose: This file pitches the app to creators and potential investors, positioning it as a solution to the fragmented, expensive audio creation process. It highlights features like inline sound effect embedding, versatile TTS options, and a drafting mode to save costs. The pitch ties the app to the creator’s journey and differentiates it through its creator-centric, cost-effective design and open-source ethos.
Key Details:
Problem: Creators face complex tools, high costs, and inefficiencies in audio production.

Solution: The app centralizes TTS, audio merging, and text processing, with features like local TTS for drafting and fallback API keys for reliability.

Target Audience: Podcasters, video creators, educators, hypnotists, and storytellers.

Unique Value: Combines spiritual roots (from the creator’s yogic practice) with practical, affordable design, adaptable to any creator’s style.

Engagement: Creators can try the app via a demo link, while investors can contact the creator to explore scaling opportunities in the content creation market.

**USER_GUIDE.md**
Purpose: This file is a user-friendly manual for interacting with the app, guiding users through its features to create audio content. It covers text input with sound effect placeholders, template management, section-based organization, voice selection, audio generation/merging, and storage options. It also provides usage scenarios (e.g., podcasting, narration) and troubleshooting advice.
Key Details:
Features: Explains how to use Section Cards (TTS or audio-only), select voices (e.g., Eleven Labs, AWS Polly), manage templates, and configure settings (API keys, storage).

Workflow: Users input text, generate audio per section, merge sections, and download the final file, with tools like grammar checks and web text import for efficiency.

Troubleshooting: Addresses common issues like API key errors, generation failures, and storage problems.

Engagement: Users should follow the guide to start creating content, configure settings for their preferred TTS providers, and refer to troubleshooting tips as needed.

**ARCHITECHTURE.md**
Purpose: This file maps the project’s structure, helping developers navigate the codebase. It organizes the project into frontend (components/, context/, pages/), backend (py_server/), functional layers (services/), and tests, detailing key files like TTSContext.jsx (state management) and gtts_server.py (local TTS). It also covers configuration files (e.g., next.config.js) and public assets.
Key Details:
Structure: Describes directories like components/ (UI, e.g., TTSApp.jsx), services/api/ (TTS and tool APIs), and py_server/ (Python backend for TTS and storage).

Configuration: Lists files like tsconfig.json and jest.config.js for project setup and testing.

Tests: Notes test files in __tests__ subdirectories for components, services, and utilities.

Engagement: Developers should use this as a reference to locate files, understand how frontend and backend integrate, and pair it with **DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md** for implementation tasks.
