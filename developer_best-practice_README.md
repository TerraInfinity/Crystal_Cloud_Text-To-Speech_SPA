Best Practices to Be Most Mindful Of
While you’re off to a strong start, the following best practices deserve extra attention as you build your application. These will enhance its flexibility and ensure it’s ready for future reuse.
1. Make API Endpoints Configurable
Current State: Your Next.js API routes (e.g., /api/textToSpeech) likely use relative paths, which work fine for a standalone app but may not adapt well to different environments.

What to Do: Use environment variables or a configuration file to define the base URL for API calls. This allows you to adjust endpoints easily if the component is used elsewhere.

Why It Matters: In a reusable component, the API might be hosted on a different server. Configurable endpoints ensure portability.
Example:
javascript

// config.js
export const API_BASE_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'https://default-api.com/api';

// services/speechService.jsx
import { API_BASE_URL } from '../config';
export const textToSpeech = async (text) => {
  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/textToSpeech`, { /* options */ });
  return response.json();
};

2. Use Scoped Styles
Current State: You have a styles/globals.css file, suggesting global styles that could conflict with other applications.

What to Do: Adopt scoped styles using CSS Modules or a prefixed Tailwind CSS setup to isolate your component’s styles.

Why It Matters: Scoped styles prevent your CSS from affecting a host application, which is critical for reusability.
Example (CSS Modules):
css

/* components/TextInput.module.css */
.textInput { /* styles */ }

javascript

// components/TextInput.js
import styles from './TextInput.module.css';
<input className={styles.textInput} />

3. Manage Assets Flexibly
Current State: Assets like demo_kundalini_kriya.json in public/ rely on relative paths, which won’t work outside your SPA’s context.

What to Do: Make asset paths configurable via environment variables or fetch them through an API.

Why It Matters: A reusable component won’t have access to your public/ folder, so flexible asset management is essential.
Example:
javascript

// Before
const data = await fetch('/demo_kundalini_kriya.json');

// After
const assetUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSET_URL || 'https://default-api.com/assets';
const data = await fetch(`${assetUrl}/demo_kundalini_kriya.json`);

4. Minimize External Dependencies
Current State: Your package.json likely lists dependencies, but I can’t see the details.

What to Do: Keep dependencies to a minimum, removing any that aren’t critical to your core functionality.

Why It Matters: Fewer dependencies reduce your app’s bundle size, making it lighter and easier to integrate elsewhere.

5. Write Tests
Current State: There’s no evidence of a tests/ directory or testing files.

What to Do: Add unit tests for components, services, and utilities using tools like Jest and React Testing Library.

Why It Matters: Tests ensure your code remains reliable as you develop and when it’s reused as a component.
